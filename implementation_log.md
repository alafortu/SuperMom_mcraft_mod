# SuperMom Mod - LLM Integration Progress Log (As of 2025-04-19 20:49)

## Completed Steps (Based on llm_integration_plan.md):

1.  **Chat Monitoring:**
    *   Hooked into `ClientChatReceivedEvent` in `ModEvents.java`.
    *   Added basic filtering for likely player messages (heuristic).
    *   LLM processing is triggered in a separate thread.

2.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   Created `LlmHelper.java` class.
    *   Implemented `gatherGameContext` to collect player status (health, hunger, position, inventory), nearby mobs, and SuperMom status (health, position, nearby mobs).
        *   *Note:* SuperMom's inventory and hunger are currently placeholders/mocked.
    *   Created `LlmRequestPayload` and `GameContext` structures.
    *   Implemented `buildPrompt` to format the context into a detailed prompt for Ollama.

3.  **LLM Communication (Ollama):**
    *   Added Gson dependency to `build.gradle`.
    *   Implemented `sendToOllama` using Java's `HttpClient` to send POST requests to the configured Ollama URL.
    *   Handles the nested JSON response structure from Ollama's `/api/generate` endpoint.

4.  **Response Parsing and Action Execution:**
    *   JSON response parsing (action, chat) is handled within `sendToOllama`.
    *   Implemented `executeLlmAction` in `LlmHelper` with a `switch` statement based on the PRD's Action Map.
        *   *Note:* The actual implementation of these actions within `SuperMomEntity` is pending (marked with `// TODO:`).
    *   Implemented `displayChat` to show SuperMom's response in the Minecraft chat.

5.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Basic error handling added for:
        *   Network exceptions during Ollama communication.
        *   HTTP status code errors from Ollama.
        *   JSON parsing errors (both outer Ollama response and inner payload).
        *   Missing Player/Level context.
        *   Missing SuperMom entity when required for an action.

6.  **Configuration:**
    *   Added `ollamaUrl` configuration setting to `Config.java` using `ForgeConfigSpec`.
    *   `LlmHelper` now reads and uses this configured URL.
    *   Added a logger to `Config.java` for config-related messages.

## Remaining Tasks / TODOs:

*   **Implement Actions in `SuperMomEntity`:** The core logic for `feed_player`, `heal_player`, `attack_mob`, `follow_player`, `go_home`, `self_heal`, `gather_food`, `prepare_supplies` needs to be added to the `SuperMomEntity` class or its AI goals.
*   **Implement Other Triggers:** Add logic to trigger LLM communication based on low player health/hunger or mob proximity, as specified in the PRD (likely requires hooking into `PlayerTickEvent` or similar).
*   **Refine Player Message Detection:** The current method in `ModEvents.onClientChatReceived` is a basic heuristic. A more robust method (e.g., checking sender UUID or using `ClientChatEvent`) should be implemented.
*   **SuperMom Status Details:** Implement actual inventory and hunger tracking for `SuperMomEntity`.
*   **Improve SuperMom Lookup:** The current method of finding the `SuperMomEntity` instance by searching nearby might be inefficient. Storing a direct reference could be better.
*   **Language Handling:** Implement language detection or configuration as specified in the PRD.
*   **Server-Side Events:** Address the potential issue noted in `ModEvents.java` where the server-side `onEntityJoinWorld` handler is in a class now marked `Dist.CLIENT`. It might need to be moved to a separate server-side event handler class.
*   **Testing (Step 7):** Thoroughly test all implemented features and error handling scenarios.
